# SGPA-and-CGPA-Calculator
This project can be used to determine a student's Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) using C++.

# Theory
SGPA :                                                                                                                                                       
The Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) is a measure used to evaluate a student's academic performance during a semester.                               
It is calculated using the formula:                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                              
      SGPA = Points secured in the semester / Credits secured in the semester.             
CGPA :                                                                                                                                                        
The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is a standard way of measuring academic performance. It combines the grade points earned by a student over several semesters or years into a single average score.                                                                                                               
It is calculated using the formula:                                                                                                                           

      CGPA = Total grade points achieved throughout all semesters / Total credits taken in all semesters.
